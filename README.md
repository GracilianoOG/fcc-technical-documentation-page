## 📖 Description

This is my solution for the *Technical Documentation Page* challenge from [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) course. It was developed with HTML and CSS purely. I decided to leave this one the way I coded in the site, the exception is the show/hide the navbar feature I made with CSS.

## 🔨 Features

* HTML
* CSS + Custom Properties
* Mobile First (responsive)
* Coded with Visual Studio Code
